# Simple ABM

This folder contains a simple agent-based model in Python (`agent_model.py`), and an extended verison of it for exploring networks (`network_model.py`). Also included in this repository are two animations for different networks:
- `network_100.mp4` has a connection distance of 100, representing a well-mixed network (low heterogeneity, long-range connections)
- `network_0.01.mp4` has a connection distance of 0.01, representing a poorly-mixed network (high heterogeneity, short-range connections)
